## 📂 Branch Structure

### 🔹 `lambda-LINQ` branch
This branch focuses on **Lambda Expressions and LINQ in C#**, emphasizing how functional-style programming simplifies data filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation.  
The problems are designed to strengthen understanding of **lambda syntax**, **LINQ query methods**, and **custom sorting logic**, including cases **with and without LINQ**.

---

### 📝 Practice Problems

- **Employee Filtering Using Lambda**
  
  Filter a collection of employees using a lambda expression to find those who:
  - Joined in the last six months
  - Belong to a specific department

- **Sort Strings by Length Using LINQ + Lambda**
  
  Use a lambda expression with LINQ’s `OrderBy()` method to sort a list of strings by their length in ascending order and print the result.

- **Group Products by Category Using LINQ**
  
  Group a list of products by category and calculate the **average price** for each category using LINQ grouping and aggregation.

- **Sort Strings by Length Using Lambda (Without LINQ)**
  
  Sort a `List<string>` by string length using a lambda expression with the `Sort()` method (no LINQ allowed).

- **Student Sorting Without LINQ**
  
  Create a `Student` class with:
  - RollNo  
  - Name  
  - Marks  

  **Tasks:**
  - Store students in a `List<Student>`
  - Sort students:
    - By **Marks (descending)**
    - If marks are equal, by **Name (ascending)**
  - Print the sorted list  
  - Use **`IComparer<Student>` or a lambda expression** (LINQ not allowed)

---

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Master **lambda expressions** in real scenarios
- Apply **LINQ for filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation**
- Understand **custom sorting using lambda and IComparer**
- Learn when and how to **avoid LINQ** and rely on core collection methods
- Improve **functional and declarative programming skills in C#**
